            <p>Welcome to the help page for <mark class="blue-highlight">Join</mark>, your guide to using our kanban project management tool. Here, we'll
                provide an overview of what <mark class="blue-highlight">Join</mark> is, how it can benefit you, and how to use it.</p>
            <h2 class="m-b-16">What is Join?</h2>
            <p><mark class="blue-highlight">Join</mark> is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by a group of dedicated students as
                part of their web development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie. <br><br>

                Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective method to visualize work, limit
                work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow). <mark class="blue-highlight">Join</mark> leverages the principles of kanban to help
                users manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual interface. <br><br>

                It is important to note that <mark class="blue-highlight">Join</mark> is designed as an educational exercise and is not intended for
                extensive business usage. While we strive to ensure the best possible user experience, we cannot

            <p class="m-b-16">Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use <mark class="blue-highlight">Join</mark>:</p>

            <div class="list">
                <div class="point">
                    <div class="num">1.</div>
                    <div class="point-text">
                        <h3>Exploring the Board</h3>
                        <p>When you log in to <mark class="blue-highlight">Join</mark>, you'll find a default board. This board represents your project and
                            contains four default lists: "To Do", "In Progress", “Await feedback” and "Done".</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="point">
                    <div class="num">2.</div>
                    <div class="point-text">
                        <h3>Creating Contacts</h3>
                        <p>In <mark class="blue-highlight">Join</mark>, you can add contacts to collaborate on your projects. Go to the "Contacts" section,
                            click on "New contact", and fill in the required information. Once added, these contacts can
                            be assigned tasks and they can interact with the tasks on the board.</p>
                    </div>

                <div class="point">

                    <div class="point-text">
                        <h3>Adding Cards</h3>
                        <p>Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards. Cards represent individual
                            tasks. Click the "+" button under the appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the
                            task details in the card, like task name, description, due date, assignees, etc.</p>

                        <h3>Moving Cards</h3>
                        <p>As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that on the board by dragging
                            and dropping the card from one list to another.</p>
