        <p>Welcome to the help page for <mark class="blue-highlight">Join</mark>, your guide to using our kanban project

            provide an overview of what <mark class="blue-highlight">Join</mark> is, how it can benefit you, and how to
            use it.</p>
        <h2 class="m-b-16">What is Join?</h2>
        <p><mark class="blue-highlight">Join</mark> is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by a
            group of dedicated students as
            part of their web development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie. <br><br>

            Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective method to visualize work, limit
            work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow). <mark class="blue-highlight">Join</mark> leverages the
            principles of kanban to help
            users manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual interface. <br><br>

            It is important to note that <mark class="blue-highlight">Join</mark> is designed as an educational exercise
            and is not intended for
            extensive business usage. While we strive to ensure the best possible user experience, we cannot
            guarantee consistent availability, reliability, accuracy, or other aspects of quality regarding <mark

        <h2 class="m-b-24">How to use it</h2>
        <p class="m-b-16">Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use <mark class="blue-highlight">Join</mark>:</p>

        <div class="list">
            <div class="point">
                <div class="num">1.</div>
                <div class="point-text">
                    <h3>Exploring the Board</h3>
                    <p>When you log in to <mark class="blue-highlight">Join</mark>, you'll find a default board. This
                        board represents your project and
                        contains four default lists: "To Do", "In Progress", “Await feedback” and "Done".</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="point">
                <div class="num">2.</div>
                <div class="point-text">
                    <h3>Creating Contacts</h3>
                    <p>In <mark class="blue-highlight">Join</mark>, you can add contacts to collaborate on your
                        projects. Go to the "Contacts" section,
                        click on "New contact", and fill in the required information. Once added, these contacts can
                        be assigned tasks and they can interact with the tasks on the board.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="point">
                <div class="num">3.</div>
                <div class="point-text">
                    <h3>Adding Cards</h3>
                    <p>Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards. Cards represent individual
                        tasks. Click the "+" button under the appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the
                        task details in the card, like task name, description, due date, assignees, etc.</p>

                <div class="point-text">
                    <h3>Moving Cards</h3>
                    <p>As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that on the board by dragging
                        and dropping the card from one list to another.</p>
