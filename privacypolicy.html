            <h2 id="m2427">Relevant Legal Bases</h2>
            <p><strong>Relevant legal bases under the GDPR:</strong> The following provides an overview of the legal bases of the GDPR on which we process personal data. Please note that national data protection regulations in your or our country of residence or domicile may also apply. If more specific legal bases are applicable in individual cases, we will inform you about them in the privacy policy.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Consent (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a GDPR)</strong> - The data subject has given their consent to the processing of their personal data for one or more specific purposes.</li>
                <li><strong>Contract performance and pre-contractual inquiries (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b GDPR)</strong> - The processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party or to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract.</li>
                <li><strong>Legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR)</strong> - The processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, provided that such interests are not overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>National data protection regulations in Germany:</strong> In addition to the data protection regulations of the GDPR, national data protection regulations apply in Germany. This includes, in particular, the Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG), which contains specific regulations on the right to information, the right to deletion, the right to object, the processing of special categories of personal data, processing for other purposes, and transmission as well as automated decision-making in individual cases including profiling. In addition, state data protection laws of the individual federal states may apply.</p>
            <p><strong>Note on the applicability of GDPR and Swiss DSG:</strong> These data protection notices serve to provide information under both the Swiss DSG and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Therefore, please note that the terms used in the GDPR are used due to broader territorial application and comprehensibility. Specifically, instead of the terms "processing" of "personal data," "overriding interest," and "particularly sensitive personal data" used in the Swiss DSG, the terms "processing" of "personal data," "legitimate interest," and "special categories of data" used in the GDPR are used. The legal meaning of the terms remains determined under the Swiss DSG.</p>
    
            <h2 id="m27">Security Measures</h2>
            <p>We take appropriate technical and organizational measures in accordance with the legal requirements, considering the state of the art, the implementation costs, and the nature, scope, circumstances, and purposes of the processing, as well as the varying likelihood and severity of the risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk.</p>
            <p>The measures include, in particular, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data by controlling physical and electronic access to the data as well as access, entry, transfer, securing of availability, and separation of data. We also have procedures in place to ensure the exercise of data subject rights, deletion of data, and responses to data threats. Furthermore, we take the protection of personal data into account during the development or selection of hardware, software, and procedures according to the principle of data protection through technology design and through data protection-friendly default settings.</p>
    
            <h2 id="m25">Transfer of Personal Data</h2>
            <p>In the course of our processing of personal data, it may happen that this data is transferred to other locations, companies, legally independent organizational units, or persons or disclosed to them. Recipients of this data may include, for example, service providers tasked with IT tasks or providers of services and content that are embedded in a website. In such cases, we comply with the legal requirements and, in particular, conclude appropriate contracts or agreements with the recipients of your data that serve to protect your data.</p>
    
            <h2 id="m24">International Data Transfers</h2>
            <p>Data processing in third countries: If we process data in a third country (i.e., outside the European Union (EU), the European Economic Area (EEA)), or if this occurs in the context of the use of third-party services or disclosure or transfer of data to other persons, entities, or companies, this will only happen in accordance with the legal requirements. If the level of data protection in the third country has been recognized by an adequacy decision (Art. 45 GDPR), this serves as the basis for the data transfer. Otherwise, data transfers will only take place if the level of data protection is otherwise ensured, in particular through standard contractual clauses (Art. 46 para. 2 lit. c GDPR), express consent, or in the case of contractual or legally required transfers (Art. 49 para. 1 GDPR). We will inform you of the basis of the third-country transfer with the individual providers from the third country, with adequacy decisions taking priority. Information on third-country transfers and existing adequacy decisions can be found on the EU Commission's website: <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection_en?prefLang=de" target="_blank">https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection_en?prefLang=de.</a></p>
            <p>EU-US Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework: Under the so-called "Data Privacy Framework" (DPF), the EU Commission also recognized the level of data protection for certain companies from the USA as secure in its adequacy decision of July 10, 2023. The list of certified companies and further information on the DPF can be found on the website of the US Department of Commerce at <a href="https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/" target="_blank">https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/</a> (in English). We will inform you in our data protection notices which service providers we use are certified under the Data Privacy Framework.</p>
    
            <h2 id="m12">General Information on Data Storage and Deletion</h2>
            <p>We delete personal data that we process in accordance with legal requirements as soon as the consents on which the processing is based are revoked or other legal grounds for the processing no longer apply. This includes, for example, if the purpose of the processing of the data no longer exists or if it is no longer necessary for the purpose.</p>
            <p>Unless the data is deleted because it is required for other and legally permissible purposes, its processing will be restricted to these purposes. This means that the data is blocked and not processed for other purposes. This applies, for example, to data that must be retained for commercial or tax law reasons or that is necessary to assert, exercise, or defend legal claims or to protect the rights of another natural or legal person. Our data protection information may also contain further information on the retention and deletion of data, which will have priority for the respective processing operations.</p>
    
            <h2 id="m10">Rights of Data Subjects</h2>
            <p>As a data subject, you have various rights under the GDPR, in particular arising from Articles 15 to 21 of the GDPR:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Right of access:</strong> You have the right to obtain confirmation as to whether data concerning you is being processed and to information about this data as well as further information and a copy of the data in accordance with legal requirements.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to rectification:</strong> You have the right, in accordance with legal requirements, to request the completion of data concerning you or the rectification of inaccurate data concerning you.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to erasure and restriction of processing:</strong> You have the right, in accordance with legal requirements, to request that data concerning you be erased without undue delay or, alternatively, to request restriction of the processing of the data in accordance with legal requirements.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to data portability:</strong> You have the right to receive data concerning you, which you have provided to us, in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format in accordance with legal requirements, or to request its transmission to another controller.</li>
                <li><strong>Complaint to supervisory authority:</strong> You also have the right, in accordance with legal requirements, to lodge a complaint with a competent supervisory authority.</li>
            </ul>
    
            <h2 id="m225">Provision of Online Services and Web Hosting</h2>
            <p>We process users' data to provide our online services. For this purpose, we process the IP address, which is required for the transmission of the contents and functions of our online services to the user's browser or terminal device.</p>
            <p>For security reasons, including the identification and combating of attacks, we also store IP addresses in log files for a limited period of time. The data is deleted when it is no longer required for these purposes.</p>
            <p>Our online services are provided by a hosting provider from whose servers the services are accessed. For this purpose, we can use infrastructure and platform services, computing capacity, storage space, and database services as well as security services and technical maintenance services.</p>
            <p>The data processed in the course of the provision of hosting services may include all information concerning users of our online services, which is generated in the course of use and communication. This includes the IP address, which is necessary to deliver the contents of online services to browsers and users' end devices, and all entries made within our online service or from websites.</p>
            <p>The collection and processing of data are based on our legitimate interests in providing our online services efficiently and securely and to communicate with users in accordance with legal requirements. The hosting provider will only process users' data in accordance with our instructions and to the extent necessary to fulfill its service obligations.</p>
    
            <h2 id="m134">Use of Cookies</h2>
            <p>Cookies are small text files or other memory notes that store information on end devices and read information from them. For example, to store the login status in a user account, the contents of a shopping cart in an e-shop, the content accessed, or the functions used in an online service. Cookies can also be used for various other purposes, for example, for the functionality, security, and comfort of online services, as well as the creation of analyzes of visitor flows.</p>
            <p><strong>Notes on consent:</strong> We use cookies in accordance with legal requirements. Therefore, we obtain prior consent from users, except where this is not legally required. In particular, consent is not necessary if storing and reading information, including cookies, is strictly necessary to provide a telemedia service expressly requested by the user. The revocable consent is clearly communicated to the users and contains the information on the respective cookie use.</p>
            <p><strong>Notes on data protection legal bases:</strong> The legal bases under data protection law on which we process users' personal data using cookies depend on whether we ask users for consent. If users consent, the legal basis for processing their data is the declared consent. Otherwise, the data processed using cookies will be processed on the basis of our legitimate interests (e.g., in a business operation of our online service and its improvement) or, if this is necessary to fulfill our contractual obligations.</p>
            <p><strong>Revocation and objection (opt-out):</strong> Users can revoke their consent at any time. Users can also object to processing under legal requirements. Users can object in particular by means of their browser settings or by clicking on the button below:</p>
            <p><a href="#m225">Cookie Settings</a></p>
            <p><strong>Further information on processing processes and services:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Processing of cookie data based on consent:</strong> We use a cookie consent management procedure, under which the user's consents to the use of cookies, or the processing and providers mentioned in the cookie consent management procedure can be obtained and managed and revoked by the user. This consent statement is stored to avoid having to repeat its query and to prove consent in accordance with the legal obligation. Storage can be on the server-side and/or in a cookie (so-called opt-in cookie or similar technologies) to be able to assign the consent to a user or their device. Subject to individual information on providers of cookie management services, the following information applies: The duration of data storage can be up to two years. A pseudonymous user identifier is created, and the time of consent, information on the scope of the consent (e.g., which categories of cookies and/or service providers), as well as the browser, system, and end device used, is stored.</li>
            </ul>
    
            <h2 id="m182">Contact and Inquiry Management</h2>
            <p>When contacting us (e.g., via contact form, email, telephone, or social media) and in the context of existing user and business relationships, the information of the inquiring persons is processed to the extent necessary to respond to the contact requests and any requested measures.</p>
            <p>The response to contact requests and the management of contact and inquiry data in the context of contractual or pre-contractual relationships are processed to fulfill our contractual obligations or to respond to (pre-)contractual requests and, otherwise, on the basis of legitimate interests in responding to inquiries and maintaining user or business relationships.</p>
